story='''this    is because we cover installing things as they are needed in the tutorial
-- this is just an additional page that gathers all of the installation instructions in one place
(which  is useful for some workshop formats).  You can  choose to install everything that is on this page
right now if you wish. But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on your computer,
skip this  chapter and we will  explain the installation parts to you later on, as they are needed.'''
