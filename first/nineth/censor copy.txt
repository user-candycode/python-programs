Anyone who loves both copywriting and swearing (who doesn’t?) will be relieved to hear that there’s a 
new tool to help with both, in the shape of Lorem fucking ipsum. The handy online tool, created by Good 
Fucking Design Advice, bills itself as the placeholder text for “people who have some fucking passion!” 
The site lets you choose either a number of paragraphs or words, and generates a barrage of very sweary 
text accordingly.

The words are delivered in Helvetica Neue or Neue Haas Grotesk, selected for “their crisp, clean details 
and typographic texture that make them aesthetically appealing and easy to read,” say the creators. 
“They have a clearly defined hierarchy of sizes and weights with known typographic results and thus 
are compatible with such special applications as design advice, printed material, and information 
existing in digitial spaces.”

We really put it to its limits, asking for 200 whole paras of profanities relating to design, and 
it served them up with no problems at all. Choice highlights include “The details are not the details.
They make the fucking design” and “You are not your fucking work. Nothing of value comes to you without 
fucking working at it.” For anyone who has packaged a document and sent it off to print, then had the 
nagging thought that there might be some Lorem Ipsum text hidden on a layout somewhere, GFDA’s new tool 
will make you check a third time.
